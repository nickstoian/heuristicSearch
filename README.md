# heuristicSearch
Heuristic Search assignment for AI course

Eight puzzle solver with 4 algorithms

The program consists of 3 files:
State.java
StateNode.java
EightPuzzle.java

The program requires user input to select the puzzle dificulty and which algorithm to use.
The program will create an outfile.txt file in it's local directory containing information about the search done.
Running the worst puzzle with the A* using tiles out of place heuristic may take a while, almost 3 minutes in my case.
